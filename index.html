                <h3>Ramanujan’s early years</h3>
                <p>
                    Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of the most famous mathematical wizards 
                    who made important contributions to 
                    the field of advanced mathematics. Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22 
                    December, 1887, to a poor Brahmin family in Erode, a small village in 
                    Tamil Nadu, India.

                <p>
                    He grew up in Kumbakonam town, near Chennai, where his father was employed 
                    as a clerk in a cloth merchant’s shop. He was an exceptionally good student 
                    and won a number of merit certificates and awards. He loved Mathematics 
                    more than any other subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once, when he was just in his middle school classes, he mathematically 
                    calculated the approximate length of the equator. He also very clearly 
                    knew the values of the square root of two and value of pi!

                <h3>Srinivasa Ramanujan – Education and work</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At the age of 16, he got a scholarship for his first year at the Government 
                        College in his hometown. His deep interest in Mathematics led him to 
                        neglect other subjects because of which he was not able to clear his 
                        examinations and had to forgo his scholarship. After dropping out of college, 
                        he had to struggle a lot to earn his living.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, it did not dampen Ramanujan’s spirits and he continued to work 
                        on problems and theorems. He bought a book authored by G. S. Carr which 
                        contained over 5000 problems. He worked and reworked all the problems 
                        and theorems and made new discoveries. He also found a job as an accounts 
                        clerk in the office of the Madras Port Trust.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then, he got in touch with V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, the founder of the Indian 
                        Mathematical Society. With his help, Ramanujan got his paper on Bernoulli 
                        numbers published in the ‘Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society’ in 1911. 
                        Soon, he became a quite popular in Chennai for his prowess in Mathematics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1913, he casually wrote to the well-known Cambridge mathematician, G. H. Hardy, 
                        and told him about his work. Hardy was mighty impressed with Ramanujan’s 
                        works and assisted him in getting a grant from Trinity College, Cambridge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ramanujan moved abroad and started to work in collaboration with Hardy, 
                        but his health started failing. Despite poor health, he remained engrossed 
                        in his research and study of newer vistas in mathematics. In 1916, he graduated 
                        from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Science by Research.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1920, he moved back to India and left for his heavenly abode.

                <h3>What is Srinivasa Ramanujan famous for?</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite having almost no formal training in Mathematics, Ramanujan’s knowledge of 
                    the subject-matter was astounding. Without the knowledge of the modern developments 
                    in the subject, he had made some important contributions to the field of 
                    mathematical analysis, number theory, game theory, infinite series and continued fractions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was a luminary who rose to great heights from a humble background and followed his 
                    heart against the odds in his way. His innovative ideas and vision still serve as a 
                    great resource for modern mathematicians.

                <h3>The Man Who Knew Infinity</h3>
                <p>
                    In the honour of Ramanujan, December 22 is now celebrated as the National Mathematics 
                    Day in India. His biography titled ‘The Man Who Knew Infinity‘ was published in 1991 and 
                    a movie based on him starring Dev Patel was also shown at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival.
